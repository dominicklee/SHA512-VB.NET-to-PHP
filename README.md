# SHA512 VB.NET to PHP
An effective solution to match a SHA512 hash from VB.NET to PHP and vice-versa.

Several months ago, I learned about SHA-512 hashing algorithms, but I was not able to find any open-source implementation on getting a private key to match from Visual Basic .NET to a PHP application on my server. I wanted to securely send data to my server in as simple way as possible while using industry-standard cryptography algorithms. This is my first approach with SHA512.

Usage instructions are on both the PHP file and the VB.NET form code. Please read them carefully.

To get the best out of this code, it is recommended you have PHP v5.3 or newer and Visual Basic 2008 or newer.

The VB.NET program is set up in a way that is ready to demonstrate the functionality. Please note that this code is distributed "as is".

I hope this helps some developers to secure their apps. Enjoy!
